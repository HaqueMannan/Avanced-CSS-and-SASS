SVG Icons vs Font Icons
--------------------------------------
- There are sevaral problems with icon fonts such as it is really a hack to display an icons which are images using as fonts, icon fonts fail more often, issues for screen-reader failing to read out icon fonts which would help the visually impaired, easy to format, etc.
- Best practice is to move away from icon fonts and use a better alternative which is SVG.
- Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a way of writing vector graphics using code.

Generate SVG in HTML
--------------------------------------
- A great website we can use for SVG icons is:
   https://icomoon.io/
- Clicking on IcoMoon App will display all the SVG icons that we can use for free in our projects.
- When we download our selected SVG from the app, we will notice a symbol-defs.svg file which is really important as it contains all the SVG's images within a single file. This is the file we would use as we would use a single global file and we can select each of the icon required. Therefore, this will optimise our web page as we only require a single HTTP request for this single file instead of requesting multiple different files.
- To include a SVG in our HTML we would use the <svg> element tag and within this element we require the <use> tag and using the attribute xlink:href in order to include the SVG file.
   <svg class="search__icon">
      <use xlink:href="img/sprite.svg#icon-magnifying-glass"></use>
   </svg>

- We use the # followed by the icon name in order to select the desired SVG icon from the symbol-defs.svg (which we can rename e.g. sprite.svg).
- The xlink:href svg will only work on a web server i.e. we would only be able to view the svg via a web server i.e. currently we can view it through live server on localhost

Format SVG Icons
--------------------------------------
- To format a SVG icons is really easy. We would set the height and width to change its size.
