Advanced Flexbox Alignment Techniques
--------------------------------------
- We can use the flex-direction to change the direction of the main axis from horizontal (row by default) to vertical (column).
- If we change the flex-direction to column, the justify-content will now apply on the main axis which is now vertical. The align-item will apply horizontally on the cross axis.
- Changing the flex-direction to column will flip both the main and cross axis from the default.

Flex-Direction:
row (default)                             column
   ---------------> Main Axis             ---------------> Cross Axis
