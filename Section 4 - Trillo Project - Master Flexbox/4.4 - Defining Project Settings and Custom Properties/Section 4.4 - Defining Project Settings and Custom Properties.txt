CSS Custom Properties
--------------------------------------
- CSS custom properties are better known as CSS variables.
- We can now use variables within CSS and would no longer require or rely on SASS variables.
- The advantages of CSS variables is that we no longer require a pre-processor and we can manipulate CSS variables in JavaScript and we can edit them in our devtools.
- CSS variables cascade and are inherited.
- CSS variables must be declared in a declaration block. We normally place this in the :root pseudo class because we want all elements to have access to these variables. The :root pseudo class is like the global parent element and therefore all child elements will have access to these variables.
- To create a custom CSS properties we use the double dash followed by the custom property name:
   --colour-primary: #eb2f64;

- This is very similar to normal css properties, but we distinguish our custom properties using the double dashes.
- To use the custom css properties/variables, we call on the var() function passing in the name of our custom properties:
   background-image: linear-gradient(to right bottom, var(--colour-primary-light), var(--colour-primary-dark));
