When to Use Flexbox
--------------------------------------
- We should decide to use flexbox when we have a one-dimensional layout i.e. one item after another going down and there are no content to the side (and vice versa).
- In many modern web design, CSS Grid is used together with flexbox.
- Therefore, we can mix the two tools/technology together to achieve our desired results.
- The display: flex property on the parent container will make the items sit side by side horizontally. If we want the flex-items to be one below another, we simply change the flex-direction to column.
- We can use flexbox to now center the items using the align/justify-content properties depending on whether aligning on the main axis or the cross axis.
- This will help the grid-items to stay vertically-centered when changing the size of the viewport.
- Note: we can use CSS Grid for one dimensional layouts as well and ignore flexbox, however, flexbox is used for one-dimensional layouts while CSS Grid is mainly used for two-dimensional layouts.
