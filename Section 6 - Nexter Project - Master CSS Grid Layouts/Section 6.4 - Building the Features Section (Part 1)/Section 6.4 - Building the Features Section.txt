Grid Inside of Grid
--------------------------------------
- To nest grid inside of each other, it is the same as in flexbox, whereby a grid-item can become a grid-container. All we simply have to do is set the display: grid; on the item itself:
   .container {
      display: grid;
   }

   .grid-item {
      ...
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);

      // grid-template-rows: auto auto;   (This is not needed because it will automatically create a implicit row. The Auto are default values).
   }

- CSS Grid Level 2 specification will bring with it sub-grid. This will allow for nesting grid i.e. the sub-grid will snap it's tracks to the parent grid. For example, it will allow the sub-grid to snap its columns to the parent grid. This will allow the small sub-grid columns to be where the overall page columns are. Currently, this is not available and we must manually create new columns for the grid on the item (i.e. sub-grid) that we have created.
