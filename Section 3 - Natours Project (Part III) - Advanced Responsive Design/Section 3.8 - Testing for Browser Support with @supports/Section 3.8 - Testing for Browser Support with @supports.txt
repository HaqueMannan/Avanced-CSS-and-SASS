Section 3.8 - Testing for Browser Support with @supports:

--------------------------------------
Learning Outcome
--------------------------------------
> How to use @supports feature queries
> Implement graceful degradation on selected properties
> How to use backdrop-filter


--------------------------------------
The @supports & Graceful Degradation
--------------------------------------
- Many new features are highly experimental and only work in top modern browsers.
- We can use the following website to see which browser versions supports the property before applying it to production:
   https://caniuse.com/
- We can use graceful degradation with the @supports in order to provide support to both modern and older browsers (older browsers will use an adapted reduced version of the CSS property).
- To add the functionality whereby a new feature should work in newer browser and have a different property applies to older browsers we would use the @supports. The example below uses the backdrop-filter which works on Safari but not Chrome.
   @supports(-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) or (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) {
      -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
      backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
      background-color: rgba($colour-black, .3);
   }
- We pass in the property within the @supports to tests/ask the browser to see if it supports the specified property.
- We have to also specify the value of the property as well in our @supports test.
- Just like media queries we can add logic using the or and and keywords.
- We would define the properties if the test property is supported.
- We have now implemented graceful degradation using the @supports query.
- If the @supports query is not supported by the browser then simply the code within this block is not applied.


--------------------------------------
The Backdrop-Filter
--------------------------------------
- The backdrop-filter applies a filter to what is behind the selected element. For example we can have a popup card and use the backdrop-filter to blur the background rather than using a dark transparency background.
   backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
   background-color: rgba($colour-black, .3);

- This adds a blur to the background while the selected element is in focus type of style to our web page.
- The backdrop-filter does not currently work on Google Chrome, but it works with Safari.
